<h2>Sorry!</h2>

<p>
	It appears that your finances require more than a latest 7 days update. This could be because you haven't logged in for a while, or because you're new. These updates can take a while and cause the server to jam up, so they're run every 12 hours instead. Full updates are done at 00:00BST and 12:00BST, check back a few minutes after those times and this area will be working again!

<p>
	To prevent this from happenning in the future, make sure you login and access either the empire or finances area every 7 days.
