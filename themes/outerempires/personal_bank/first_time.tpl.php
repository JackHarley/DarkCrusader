<h2>Welcome to your Personal Bank!</h2>

<p>
	Personal bank allows you to track your finances and see where you're spending and earning your credits.<br />
	It generates pretty graphs, and in future will let you see your profitability in things like colonies, by tracking sale of goods you choose, and costs of workers.<br />
	There's also loads of other features in the work which you'll see appear soon!
</p>

<p>
	All of the stats and info are calculated on the fly from data pulled from the API. We do not store any of your bank transactions or information.
