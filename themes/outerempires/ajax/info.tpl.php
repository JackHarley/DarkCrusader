<h2>Territory Notice</h2>
<p>
	DkCru colonised systems are out of bounds to <strong><i>all</i></strong> other factions. Independents may colonise under the knowledge that a DkCru member may request they remove themselves if a member wants a spot on that planet/moon.
	DkCru station systems are out of bounds to <strong><i>all</i></strong> other factions and independents. Colonising in a DkCru system is seen as an act of war/aggression, and DkCru will respond by removing the colony, and may pursue military actions against the player and or faction who placed the colonies.
